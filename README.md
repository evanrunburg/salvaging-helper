# Salvaging Helper
Sailing's best training method just got even better: a helper plugin for salvaging shipwrecks by GIM Inspire.

# Features

Get customized overlays and alerts based on your salvaging style, activity level, and current step in the salvaging process. Salvaging helper keeps track of things so you don't have to, whether you're on the hook, sitting back and sorting, or anything in between.

View shipwreck salvaging radius and hook 'true tile' to make sure you're always in the perfect double spot.

Manage and configure loot options without ruining your overworld Menu Entry Swapper settings.

No more setting sail: dynamically hide left click options for annoying objects, facilities, and NPCs while near a shipwreck so you never click the wrong thing again.

Have it your way: configure every option down to the item through a fully-featured side panel user interfact.

Stop ruining other plugins: keep your other settings tidy by obviating the need to constantly swap between what you want at sea and what you want on the land. This plugin plays nice with and reduces or eliminates the need for: custom Watchdog alerts, extensive Inventory Tags, Menu Entry Swapper setup.
